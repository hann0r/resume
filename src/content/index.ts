      "Based in Rural Africa (Sangilo Village, Malawi) The project was partially Government funded but also saw me fundraise £800 in order to support the Charity to fund further young people to volunteer overseas. The target was reached by hosting car boot sales, baking cakes, talking with local neighbours and writing to my local paper (The Royston Crow) that kindly wrote an article about the Malawian mission which included my Just-Giving fundraising webpage. Contact with my local Rotary Club was also made and they very generously donated a large percentage of the target with the agreement of holding a speech/presentation on my return. I was invited to the club as a guest speaker in January 2015 and presented my experience to the entire committee. The situation – Supporting children to gain access to primary school education in a community that had no access to electricity or the internet. Working in a team of 18 (9 UK volunteers and 9 Malawian volunteers) Tasks included: Construction of a new nursery building. Raising the standard of education through the teachers by creating an up to date and relevant learning syllabus and new learning resources. Awareness sessions within the Primary Schools, A parents evening, Adult Literacy classes, A talent show for all the students. Covering topics such as: Geography, Hygiene and Sanitation and Culture, diversity / HIV & AIDS and others diseases",
